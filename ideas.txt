ANIMATIONS:

Default landing page transition -->
    1. Landing page asks for name with from
    2. Once entered, the circle shrinks as if falling down from a 3D top-down view.
    3. As it 'settles' into its new position as the central 'nameCircle' element, it will send out 'ripples' which form the other circles 
    4. These then also settle and expand slightly when moused over

Trenchcoat landing page transition -->
    1. Similar to default but you write your name on a bullet which loads into the chamber, and the revolver's cylinder is spun
  
Phone ability view --> 
    1. On a phone, each ability can be chosen from the central circular view
    2. Once in the view, the 'wheel' consisting of the 'abilityCircle' element will be on the left side of the screen
    3. You can spin it with your finger to change the ability view without having to go back to the central view

Ability distribution -->
    1. User may toggle a button to see the 'radar chart' of their ability scores, radially emnating from the centre
